### Overview
The state of Iowa provides many datasets on their website, including [this dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pf5n5sgfgiri3i8/AACkaMeL_i_WgZ00rpxOOcysa?dl=0) which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license. My goal was to assist a hypothetical liquor store owner in Iowa in expanding to new locations throughout the state. I investigated the market data by building a model to fit the data. The model of total sales was based on location, price per bottle, total bottles sold. I built models organized by county, zip code, and city. I provided a table of the best performing stores by location and offer general location recommendations to the business owner.
